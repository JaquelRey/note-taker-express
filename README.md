### [Deployed to Heroku](https://note-takepurr.herokuapp.com/)
## Description  
This project is a simple note taking app that saves notes as json. I built the back end as practice with REST APIs.

## Details  
### Features  
Notes can be saved, viewed, and deleted. Console logs are pretty robust for a small app (I think)  
### Technologies  
Notes are saved as JSON using Node.fs, with custom ids generated by uuidv4. Middleware and Express are used on the back end to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests.  
### Dependencies  
Express@4.18.1 and uuid@9.0.0  
  
## Installation  
Clone this repository locally, and navigate to it's root in your terminal. Assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, run the command ```npm install``` to get the package dependencides installed. You can start the app with localhost by running ```npm start``` most users will be able to access it from the browser at localhost:3001/

Once again I'd like to thank MDN, w4schools, and stackoverflow. Express and Node documentation were wonderful to reference (and go down the rabbithole)
